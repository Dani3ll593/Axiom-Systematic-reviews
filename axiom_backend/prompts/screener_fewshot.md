### 🟢 EXAMPLE 1: CLEAR INCLUSION
**INPUT CRITERIA:** {"population": {"include": ["adults with type 2 diabetes"]}, "intervention": {"include": ["machine learning", "predictive model"]}, "study_design": {"include": ["RCT"]}}

**INPUT ABSTRACT:** "We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 450 adults with type 2 diabetes in Mexico to evaluate whether a machine learning model can predict HbA1c levels at 12 months."

**OUTPUT:**
{
  "decision": "include",
  "reason": null,
  "confidence": "high",
  "criteria_met": {
    "population": true,
    "intervention": true,
    "study_design": true,
    "temporal": true,
    "language": true
  },
  "justification": "The study describes a randomized controlled trial [Source abstract] targeting adults with type 2 diabetes. The intervention evaluated is a machine learning model, satisfying all PICOS eligibility criteria."
}

### 🔴 EXAMPLE 2: CLEAR EXCLUSION (ELIMINATION HIERARCHY)
**INPUT CRITERIA:** {"population": {"include": ["adults with type 2 diabetes"], "exclude": ["pediatric", "type 1 diabetes"]}, "study_design": {"exclude": ["case report"]}}

**INPUT ABSTRACT:** "We present a case report of a pediatric patient with type 1 diabetes who responded well to insulin pump therapy."

**OUTPUT:**
{
  "decision": "exclude",
  "reason": "wrong_study_design",
  "confidence": "high",
  "criteria_met": {
    "population": false,
    "intervention": false,
    "study_design": false,
    "temporal": true,
    "language": true
  },
  "justification": "The study design is explicitly stated as a 'case report' [Source abstract], which is a direct exclusion criterion. Furthermore, the population is a pediatric patient with type 1 diabetes, failing the adult DM2 requirement."
}

### 🟡 EXAMPLE 3: UNCERTAIN CASE (ESCALATED TO HUMAN / REASONING MODEL)
**INPUT CRITERIA:** {"population": {"include": ["adults with type 2 diabetes"]}, "intervention": {"include": ["machine learning"]}, "study_design": {"include": ["RCT", "observational cohort"]}}

**INPUT ABSTRACT:** "A cross-sectional survey of 200 diabetes patients assessed satisfaction with telemedicine follow-up."

**OUTPUT:**
{
  "decision": "uncertain",
  "reason": null,
  "confidence": "low",
  "criteria_met": {
    "population": true,
    "intervention": false,
    "study_design": false,
    "temporal": true,
    "language": true
  },
  "justification": "The population involves diabetes patients, but the study design is a cross-sectional survey (not an RCT or observational cohort). The intervention focuses on telemedicine rather than a predictive machine learning model [Source abstract]. This abstract requires human adjudication to determine if the intervention and design criteria are flexible."
